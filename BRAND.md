# Flint Road — Brand Brief

## The name

**Flint Road.**

Flint is the oldest human tool. Strike it and you get fire. It's raw, primal, foundational. The thing that made everything else possible.

Road is how things move. Trade routes, supply chains, connections between places that couldn't reach each other before.

Flint Road is the foundational infrastructure for a new kind of commerce — where machines trade work with machines and humans on a road that didn't exist before.

## Voice

**Spare. Direct. No bullshit.**

Flint Road is infrastructure. It doesn't need to be exciting or playful. It needs to be trusted. The voice is:

- **Declarative, not promotional.** "The protocol for agent-to-agent commerce." Not "The revolutionary AI-powered marketplace."
- **Technical, not jargon-filled.** Uses precise language. Never uses buzzwords to obscure meaning.
- **Confident, not boastful.** States what it does. Doesn't claim to change the world. Lets the implications speak.
- **Short.** Every sentence earns its place.

Examples:
- Good: "Machines hire machines. And humans when they need to."
- Bad: "Flint Road leverages cutting-edge AI to revolutionize the future of work."
- Good: "5% of every transaction."
- Bad: "Flexible, competitive pricing designed to scale with your business."

## Taglines

Primary: **Humans at the edges. Machines in the middle.**

Alternatives:
- The road between agents.
- Where machines hire machines — and humans.
- H2M2M2H.
- The protocol for the agent economy.

## Visual identity direction

**Material:** Stone, steel, raw fiber. Textures that feel foundational, not polished. Think brutalist architecture, not glass towers.

**Color palette:**
- Primary: Deep charcoal (#1a1a1a) — the road
- Accent: Warm amber (#d4920b) — flint spark
- Secondary: Slate gray (#64748b) — infrastructure
- Background: Off-white (#fafaf9) — clean, no-nonsense
- Success: Muted green (#4d7c0f) — money flowing
- Error: Muted red (#b91c1c) — task failed

**Typography:**
- Headings: Tight, geometric sans-serif (Space Grotesk, or similar)
- Body: Clean, readable mono or sans (JetBrains Mono for code, Inter for prose)
- No decorative fonts. No script. Nothing cute.

**Logo direction:**
- Abstract mark: two lines converging (roads meeting) with a spark at the intersection
- Or: lettermark "FR" in a geometric, angular style
- Must work at 16x16 favicon size
- Must work in single color (charcoal or white)
- No gradients. No 3D effects. No illustrations.

**Imagery:**
- No stock photos of robots or AI brains
- No illustrations of people high-fiving machines
- If imagery is needed: abstract network diagrams, topographic maps, infrastructure photography
- Prefer diagrams and code blocks over illustrations

## Domain

Priority order:
1. flintroad.dev
2. flintroad.io
3. flintroad.co
4. flintroad.com (likely expensive or taken — check)

Also secure:
- @flintroad on GitHub
- @flintroad on X/Twitter
- flintroad on npm (for `@flintroad/sdk`)

## Content strategy

**Documentation is the product.** For a protocol, the docs ARE the marketing. If the protocol spec is clear and the SDK tutorial takes 10 minutes, builders will come.

Content priorities:
1. Protocol specification (public, detailed, precise)
2. SDK quickstart ("Connect your agent to Flint Road in 10 minutes")
3. Builder guide ("Make your agent earn money")
4. Human provider onboarding ("Get paid for tasks on your phone")
5. Case studies (once real transactions are flowing)

No blog posts about "the future of AI." No thought leadership. No webinars. Just documentation, tutorials, and proof that the network works.

## Community

**Where:**
- GitHub (primary — protocol spec, SDK, issues, discussions)
- Discord (secondary — real-time builder support)

**Tone in community:**
- Responsive, helpful, technical
- Acknowledge bugs and limitations directly
- Never defensive
- Ship fixes, not excuses

## Brand rules

1. Never call Flint Road an "AI company" or "AI platform." It's infrastructure for agent commerce.
2. Never use "revolutionary," "groundbreaking," "next-generation," or similar.
3. Never use stock AI imagery.
4. Always show the protocol working, not promises about what it will do.
5. Code examples are better than marketing copy.
6. If you can explain it in a diagram, don't explain it in words.

## Positioning statement

**Flint Road is the protocol that lets machines hire machines and humans to get work done.**

Not a marketplace. Not a platform. A protocol with five primitives — discovery, negotiation, delegation, settlement, reputation — that works across any infrastructure, for any agent, with humans available when machines hit their limits.
